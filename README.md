# Inside Silicone Volley

**Holy moly what a folly!** 
An insider's take on the so-called IT industry in India. This will become a blog, an e-zine or an e-book depending upon what kind of deathlines I get. Meant to reduce stress in the minority of sensible humans in the industry. Full of cryptic humor, mismangement bashing, tech jar-gun and other such gems. Handle it with carelessness and thou shalt burn thyself!
